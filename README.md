## Experimental Repo epl-ml-mono-repo
- EPL [English Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/)
- ML [Machine Learning](https://tensorflow.org/js/)
- mono-repo [Lerna based JS mono repo](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#readme)

### This is an experimental project intended to test the following technologies

- tensorflow 
- typescript
- lerna
- greenkeeper/renovate/regenerate

The intention for this project is to overcome the lerning required to build a predictive
engine from EPL resuls win, loose and draw over the lifetime of the EPL in order to make
an engine to predict future games.

As with all academic exercises it is hoped that the experiences gained from the testing
and use of this may be applied in a general way to other data sets so that a prediction 
may be made.

### requirements
To run the integration tests a mongo db is required.
