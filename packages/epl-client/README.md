# `@gvhinks/epl-client`

## How to run 

```bash
npm run start
```

The web based client will try to communicate with 

```javascript
http://localhost:3000
```

The **epl-host-model** program will need to be running to host the endpoints
for 

```javascript
http://localhost/model.json
http://localhost/weights.bin
```

Those files are the output from the **epl-base-model**
