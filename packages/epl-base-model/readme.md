# model

Give simple historical data about a club make a future prediction of a match. 


Starting with a historical data set of results for clubs use the most simple data.

- home club name ( one hot encoded ) let us call this team Arsenal
- away club name ( one hot encoded ) let us call this team West Ham
- Take the results which can be win, loose, draw and apply them to the home team

There have been 36 teams in the historical data and the one hot encoding for this from our data set is as follows

| team name | one hot encoded team name |

For a home team a model will be built that reflects all previous results against any of the other 35 teams.

When a model has been built predictions will be made against a set of test data.
