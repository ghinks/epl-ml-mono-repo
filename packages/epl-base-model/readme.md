# model

I am only tring to demonstrate the usage of the tensor flow library. There 
is no real target goal. So one needs to be created.

**what is the most simply prediction I could make**

**Maybe just past wins against a specific club**

Given training data that has results agains club A for club B
what sort of prediction should we be making going forwards?


```markdown
 { 
    opponents: string,
    win: num 0-1
    loss: num 0-1
    draw: num 0-1
 }
```
what prediction can we make about club B when it plays club A?

Is that simple enough?

So what are the inputs and what are the labels? A very simple way of looking at it 
is to take the teams alone to begin with.
