# model

## description
This is a node based model generation package. It will use the training data to produce a model of the premier league
base on all the fixture results. The default date range is defined by a RegExp which defaults to 

```javascript
/^20[0-9][0-8].*/
```

Which means the default training data uses all results up to but not including those in 2019.

Each club in the premier league is **one hot encoded** as in the table below. 

The prediction produces an array of three numbers corresponding to the possibility of a 

- home win
- away win
- draw

so a prediction of team A vs team B with a prediction of **[ 1, 0, 0]** would mean a home win is predicted.

There have been 36 teams in the historical data and the one hot encoding for this from our data set is as follows

| team name | one hot encoded team name |

For a home team a model will be built that reflects all previous results against any of the other 35 teams.

When a model has been built predictions will be made against a set of test data.

# testing

The test set, which was kept back from the training data produced a 60% accuracy score
on the first pass without any model tuning. The test set fixtures were the results of 
games in 2019 for the 2018/2019 season (ie the second half of the season).
